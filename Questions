Hunter at Amazon / Software Engineer
What is a typical day (or week) like for you?
  - There will be days where I am insanely busy going through lines of code trying to fix bugs that appear for my department, as well as days that are slower where I get to work on new additions to our code. 
● What do you like most about your work?
  - The flexibility to create as well as maintain someone else's vision. 
● What do you like least about your work?
  - The competitive nature of the market. 
● What kinds of problems do you deal with?
  - Anywhere from total outages to being woken up at 3 am by one of my peers because we have to hop on to fix some lines of code for the next morning to run smoothly. I love it, but that might be a problem that others see. 
● What kinds of decisions do you make?
  - I have to be able to use my time effectively, so I am always making the tough decisions on where to focus my energy for the day, as well as when to work on new types of projects.
